# Vitis Data Analytics Library

Vitis Data Analytics Library is an open-sourced Vitis library written in C++ for accelerating data analytics applications in a variety of use case.

It now contains two levels of accelration: module level and pre-defined kernel level. In module level, it provides optimized hardware implementation of most common used building blocks for data analytics. In kernel level, it can be used to accelerate basic data analytics algorithm.
