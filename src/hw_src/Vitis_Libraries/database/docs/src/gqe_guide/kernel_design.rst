Join Kernel
===========

The GQE join kernel is a compound of multiple post-bitstream programmable primitives,
and can execute not only hash-join but also a number of primitives often found as
prologue or epilogue of join operations. With its bypass design in data path,
it can even perform execution without a join.

The internal of this kernel is illustrated in the figure above. Internal multi-join supports
three reconfigurable modes, namely inner join, anti-join and semi-join.
This kernel works with three input buffers, two for data and one for configuration,
and it emits result to one output buffer, with same data structure as its data input buffers.

The uniformed buffer content structure design allows this kernel to be seamlessly scheduled,
using one's output as successor's input. Basically, a buffer contains an input table
or an intermediate result table, and each table has a list of data columns,
placed one after another and aligned to 512b boundaries.

Each column's data structure is essentially a 512-bit header, followed by raw data.

.. NOTE::
   In the current release, all columns are expected to have the same number of elements of same type,
   so only the first columns header is used by kernel. This will likely change in future release.

The buffer and column's data structure is shown in the figure below.

The configuration buffer basically programs the kernel at runtime. It toggles execution step
primitives on or off, and defines the filter and/or evaluation expressions.
The details are documented in the following table:

+---------+---------------+--------------+--------------+--------+----------+----------+---------+---------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (padding at MSB) filter Tab B config (cont')                                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Both input table A and B can support up to 8 columns.
The selection and order of columns in pipeline is appointed via the column index.
Within each buffer, the columns are indexed starting from 0.
``-1`` is used as a special value to instruct the table scanner to feed zero for that column.

For example, suppose Table A's column indices are ``[3,2,1,-1,-1]``.
Then Column 3 will be the first in data path, and Column 2 the second and Column 1 the third.
Column 0 and other columns if exists are ignored.
The last two slots in data path will be filled with zeros.

The filter config is aligned to lower bits, and each filter's config fully covers the first two
512-bit slots, and partially use the third one.

Here the ``join_on`` option toggles whether hash-join is enabled or by-passed in the pipeline.

The ``dual_key`` option instructs the kernel to use
both first and second column as join key in hash-join, and when it is asserted, the third column
becomes the first part of the payload input.

The ``join sel`` option indicates the work mode of multi-join, 0 for normal hash join, 1 for semi-join and
2 for anti-join.

The ``append`` option toggles whether the append mode is enabled during writing out consecutive joined table.
This option would be usually used when it joins two sub-tables after hash partition.

The eval config is for the :ref:`cid-xf::database::dynamicEval` primitive,
and aligns to the lower bits of the 512-bit allocated for it.

The aggregation always performs the calculation of min, max, sum and count for each of its input column.
When ``aggr_on`` is set, aggregation values will write instead of the original rows.

.. CAUTION::
   To support large sum and count, the output data width of these two fields are doubled.
   So that the aggregation value for each column is ``min, max, sum LSB, sum MSB, count LSB, count MSB``.

The write option is basically a bit mask for 8 slots in data path.
Only when the corresponding one-hot bit is asserted, the column is written to the output buffer.

.. CAUTION::
   Due to limitation in current ``write_out``, the output buffer must always
   provide 8 column slots, even not all used.

The hardware resource utilization of join kernel is shown in the table below (work as 182MHz).

Aggregate Kernel
================

The GQE Aggregate kernel is another key kernel of General Query Engine (GQE),
and supports both grouping and non-grouping aggregate operations.

.. image:: /images/gqe_aggr_kernel.png
   :alt: GQE Aggregate Kernel
   :scale: 60%
   :align: center

The internal structure of this kernel is shown in the figure above. It consists of one scan and write,
two evaluations, one filter, hash group aggregate as well as one aggregate primitive. Raw input table is
scanned in or write out by column. Before entering into hash group aggregate module, each element in each
row will be evaluated and filtered. Thus, some new elements can be generated and some rows will be
discarded behind. Moreover, two cascaded evaluation modules are added to support more complex expression.

Hash group aggregate is the key module in this kernel, which is a multi-PU implementation and given
in the following diagram. Each PU requires 2 HBM banks and some URAM memory blocks to buffer distinct
keys as well as payloads after aggregate operations. And one internal loop is implemented to consume
all input rows with each iteration. Furthermore, all PUs are working in parallel to achieve higher
performance.

Also, the data structure of input and output tables is same as join kernel. The whole configuration is
composed of 128 32-bit slot. And the details of configuration buffers are listed in the table:

Partition Kernel
================

The GQE partition kernel can partition one table's rows into corresponding clusters according to hash of selected
key columns. This kernel is designed to scale the problem size that can be handled by the GQE Join or Aggregate kernel.
To reduce the size of intermediate data, it is equipped with dynamic filter like other kernels.

.. image:: /images/gqe_part_kernel.png
   :alt: GQE Part Kernel
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

The internal of this kernel is illustrated in the figure above. It consists of two input buffers and one output buffer.
Firstly, the kernel scans the input tables into multiple columns and then it filters them (if the related condition is
given in configuration buffer). After that, each row will be dispatched into various buckets based on the hash value of
primary key. Finally, every full hash bucket will trigger on one burst write into output buffer.

The details for hash partition is shown in the following figure. One URAM array is used to buffer one burst length rows
for each hash part. And the following module behind build PU will spilt each row into multiple columns for compatible
output format with other kernels.

.. image:: /images/gqe_part_detail.png
   :alt: Detais Diagram of Hash Partition
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

To simplify the design, GQE partition kernel can reuse the scan and filter configuration with GQE join kernel. Also,
as mentioned above, the data structure of input and output tables is the same as join kernel.

The hardware resource utilization of single hash partition is shown in the table below (work as 200MHz).

.. ATTENTION::
    To use the GQE Partition kernel, host must pass the number of partitions through a kernel argument,
    create corresponding number of sub-buffers on Partition kernel's output,
    and invoke GQE Join or Aggregate kernel multiple times accordingly.
