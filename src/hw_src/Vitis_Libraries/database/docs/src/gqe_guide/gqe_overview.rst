As explained in the :ref:`use_case` section, Generic Query Engine (GQE) is our
solution for general acceleration in database.

The GQE consists of a hardware overlay of post-bitstream programmable
kernel(s) and corresponding software stack.
It can process different tasks with the same xclbin downloaded into Alveo card.

In Level 2 acceleration, we provide the GQE's kernel(s) as documented APIs,
so that advanced developers can mix or extend the kernels for their own design.
