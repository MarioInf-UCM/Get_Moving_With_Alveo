Typical Use Cases
=================

Database acceleration can be achieved in different granularity and flexibility, and this library supports the following use cases:

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Acceleration Scope             | Developer's Usage of Database Library                                                        |
+================================+==============================================================================================+
| One hot SQL query              | Write a query-specific kernel with modules from the library.                                 |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Specific query step            | Write a dedicated kernel for some specific execution step [1]_, like hashing.                |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| General SQL query acceleration | Use or derive predefined kernels from library to offload matching execution step(s) to FPGA. |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Developers targeting the first or second use case may reference the :ref:`module_guide` section,
while those aim to accelerate database on general cases could find the most related info in :ref:`gqe_guide` section.

Developers looking for fast FPGA adoption in database without going into hardware details should look into the
:ref:`gqe_l3_guide`, in which we will present our overlay with pure software APIs.

.. NOTE::
   L3 Overlay is still under active development now. Stay tuned!
